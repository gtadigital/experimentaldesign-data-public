## Abstract
Heinz Isler (1926-2009) is one of the most renowned Swiss engineers of the second half of the 20th century. In particular his thin concrete shells had a significant impact on the development of civil engineering in the second half of the century. Isler’s work was largely based on experimental design methods, which he constantly tested and verified at various scales using models which must be recognized as his central design tools.

The success of  Isler’s shells was possible under specific economic conditions over a period of around three decades: from the end of the 1950ies onwards, the engineer succeeded in winning a large number of commissions, especially from Swiss industry. However, the economy of thin concrete shells suffered a noticeable slump from the end of the 1970ies onwards. It can be assumed that economic conditions during the boom years after the Second World War had a decisive influence on Isler’s building production – as these changed, construction activity based on them also had to face a crisis. In addition, it must be asked to what extent the perception of «progressive» engineering structures in general and of concrete as a building material in particular, which was also conveyed in the media, changed in the wake of the criticism of modernity from the 1970ies onwards, and whether this also explains the crisis of the «System Isler».

Based on Isler's posthumous papers, which are kept at the gta Archives of ETH Zurich, the publication project examines Isler’s contribution to building production in the second half of the 20th century from a cultural and engineering history perspective. To achieve a comprehensive embedding of Isler’s work in the historical context, his contribution has to be examined in the light of its contemporary field, also considering parallel, possibly conflicting developments and trends. This research will on the one hand provide new insights both into the professional exchange between engineers and architects in design and construction processes as well as into the building economy with its specific conditions. On the other hand it will shed light on the public discourse on architecture and engineering in a time that significantly shapes the face of our built environment still today.

## Method
The present data set includes both the source data (a) and the research data (b) resulting from the SNSF-funded research project [»Experimental Design in the Post-War Period - Heinz Isler's (1926-2009)«](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/179095): 
	
a) Source data have been collected within the gta Collections Management System ([CMS](https://collections.gta.arch.ethz.ch/)). They include both the holding data of the Heinz Isler bequest (gta Archives/ETH Zurich) and scholarly observation  that have been collected as part of the research project. Source data are provided as full XML export from the Collection Management System. 

b) research data consist of a transformation of holding data and related scholarly observation into a machine-processable RDF format for FAIR access and reuse. As the general underlying ontology, the ISO certified Conceptual Reference Model ([CRM](https://www.cidoc-crm.org/)) of International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) is being used. The data model for the actual mapping complies with Bruseker G, Carboni, N., et al. [Semantic Reference Data Models](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/) (SDRM) provided by the Swiss Art Research Infrastructures (SARI). 

The data models specifically used are: 
- [Places (E53)](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/place/)
- [Persons (E21)](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/persons/)
- [Groups (E74)](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/group/)
- [Archival Units (E78)](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/archival/)
- [Digital Objects (D1)](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/do/)

The conceptual modelling for Built Works and Project follows Guillem, A. and Bruseker, G. [Creative Processes Representation](https://github.com/Habennin/crmcpr). A conceptual model extending CIDOC CRM and FRBR for the description of creative processes, 2019. 

The transformation of the source data is using 3M modelling software for content mapping and [X3ML](https://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/x3ml-toolkit) for data transformation. For validating and visualisation purpose, the data are being ingested into the open source Semantic Linked Data Platform [ResearchSpace](https://github.com/researchspace/researchspace). 

The present data set includes all data available at the project end. An updated version of the same data will be available at [GitHub](https://github.com/gtadigital/experimentaldesign-data-public). The later will include additional data and data visualisation related to the planned book publication (due 2023).
